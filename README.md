# Twitter-to-Pocket

I have a very bad habit of send important tweet's to myself for later reading and because of this is how my twitter DM looks like ðŸ˜…

![like this](https://screenshots.firefoxusercontent.com/images/fe085dd7-de9a-4a84-82c7-021d9deb43ed.png)

So, I want to **make a twitter bot that can read my message's (from a particular person, most probabily myself ) and send/save them to my pocket account.**
If you can help me in any context , please **email** to sharmakhushal78@gmail.com or send a **direct message** on [twitter ](http://twitter.com/herkuch) or **you can create a issue too**.
ThanksðŸ˜Š
