# Twitter-to-Pocket

I have a very bad habit of send important tweet's to myself for later reading so,
I want to make a twitter bot that can read my message's (from a particular person, most probabily myself ) and send/save them to my pocket account.
If you can help me in any context , please email to sharmakhushal78@gmail.com or send a direct message on [twitter ](http://twitter.com/herkuch).
ThanksðŸ˜Š

This is how my twitter DM looks like ðŸ˜… ![like this](https://screenshots.firefoxusercontent.com/images/fe085dd7-de9a-4a84-82c7-021d9deb43ed.png)
